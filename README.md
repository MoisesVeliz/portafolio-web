# Web Portfolio Template

A simple web portfolio template inspired by [MoureDev's portfolio template](https://github.com/mouredev/portafolio-template).

## Why This Project?

This project was created for several reasons:
- As a personal practice project to improve coding skills
- To build a personal portfolio website
- To create an easy-to-implement solution without complex dependencies or unfamiliar libraries

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Mobile Responsive**: The template is optimized for mobile devices, providing an improved viewing experience across different screen sizes.

### Disadvantages
- **Color Customization Complexity**: Changing the portfolio's color scheme requires globally replacing color references (e.g., "teal"), which can be more complex than other customization methods.
